# Responsive Web Page from Figma Design

## Project Overview
This project involves taking a design from Figma and turning it into a fully functional, responsive web page.  
The goal is to match the design as closely as possible while ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

When the screen width is 480px or less, the page should automatically switch to the mobile layout.  
All interaction details, such as hover effects, button states, and spacing, should follow the original design.

## Requirements
- Recreate the exact look of the provided Figma file.
- Make the layout responsive so it adapts to different screen sizes.
- Use the correct fonts, colors, and spacing.
- Add hover and active effects for buttons and links.
